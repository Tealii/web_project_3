          total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions.
          Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a

            <p class="place-info__paragraph">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s,
              this is an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
              majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss.
              As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an
              arduous trek.</p>
            <p class="place-info__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first
              European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to
              L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for
              your 3-month expedition. </p>

              than in springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s,
              this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy
              it while it lasts.</p>
            <p class="place-info__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't
              it make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
              outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state.
              Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged,
              waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may
              be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also
              better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

              NY also has several other reasons for going down in history. Since the late
              1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home
              to the world-famous General Electric Company.</p>
            <p class="place-info__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as
              well as contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would
              be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to
              help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light
              from GE will set you back about $10-20.</p>

              word “eerie,” although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
              passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most
              famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by
              Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather
              decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
            <p class="place-info__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you
              haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious
              word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company.
              Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during
              this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National
              Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>
            <p class="place-info__paragraph">The current cost of a Hershey's
              Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

              coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
              surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200
              of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776.
              However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located
              state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is
              waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one
              of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach
              it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you can
              before continuing your bike ride!</p>
